Project Overview
GlobalSeismicActivity2023 is a data-driven project aimed at analyzing global earthquake data for the year 2023. This project leverages Python to conduct various analyses, including temporal trends, geospatial distributions, magnitude analysis, seismic station coverage, and error evaluation in earthquake data. The goal is to provide insights into seismic patterns, highlight high-risk regions, and assess the global seismic monitoring infrastructure.

Data Source
The dataset includes global earthquake data for 2023, with details on earthquake occurrences, magnitudes, locations, depths, and the number of reporting seismic stations. Data was sourced from [relevant data source].

Analyses Conducted
Temporal Analysis: Evaluating the frequency and distribution of earthquakes over each month of the year.
Geospatial Analysis: Visualizing the geographical distribution of earthquakes on a global map.
Magnitude Analysis: Analyzing the range and frequency of earthquake magnitudes.
Station Analysis: Assessing the coverage and reporting efficacy of seismic stations.
Error Analysis: Evaluating the accuracy in the reporting of earthquake locations, depths, and magnitudes.
